Device tree binding for NVIDIA Tegra XUSB OTG Controller Driver (XOTG)
============================

The Tegra XOTG driver works with Tegra host and device controller drivers to
provide OTG2.0 (OTG3.0 supported, but not implemented yet in SW)
functionalities. The host and device controller drivers must both contain
otg-controller phandle pointing to XOTG node. Host or device driver only
depends on XOTG driver. If a system has OTG port but either XHCI or XUDC
is not enabled, the port still works fine as long as XOTG is enabled. In
other words, either one or both XHCI and XUDC should work fine as long as
XOTG is enabled.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible: For Tegra186, must contain "nvidia,tegra186-xotg".

Required properties for Tegra186:
---------------------------------
 - interrupts: interrupt line for XOTG
 - phys: Must contain at least an entry for USB2.0 phy for the OTG port, and
   at most an additional entry for USB3.0 phy if the OTG port is USB3.0.
   See ../phy/phy-bindings.txt for details.
 - phy-names: Should include at least an entry for USB2.0 phy and at most
   another entry for USB3.0 phy.
   Names must be "otg-usb2", and "otg-usb3" if the port supports SuperSpeed.
   - "otg-usb3" phy, SuperSpeed (SSTX+/SSTX-/SSRX+/SSRX-) data lines
   - "otg-usb2" phy, USB 2.0 (D+/D-) data lines
 - extcon-cables: Must contains 2 cables for ID and VBUS detection.
   See ../extcon/extcon-gpio-states.txt for details.
 - extcon-cable-names: Must be "id" and "vbus".

Optional properties:
--------------------
 - otg-rev: See generic.txt for details
 - hnp-disable: See generic.txt for details
 - adp-disable: See generic.txt for details
 - srp-disable: See generic.txt for details
 - rsp-disable: See generic.txt for details

Example:
--------
	xotg {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-xotg";
        interrupts = <0 167 0x4>;
		phys = <&padctl TEGRA_PADCTL_UTMI_P(0)>, /* USB 3.0 micro-AB, J503 */
			<&padctl TEGRA_PADCTL_USB3_P(1)>; /* USB 3.0 micro-AB, J503 */
		phy-names = "otg-usb2", "otg-usb3";
		extcon-cables = <&vbus_id_extcon 1>, <&vbus_id_extcon 0>;
		extcon-cable-names = "id", "vbus";
		#extcon-cells = <1>;

        otg-rev = <0x0300>;
        adp-disable;
	};
