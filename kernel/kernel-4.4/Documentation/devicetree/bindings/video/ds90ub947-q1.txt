- init-regs : an array of 8b values. The array should contain consecutive
    groups of 3 values, each group containing reg address, mask, and data.
	Data is written to each register using the mask, in a read/modify/write fashion.

	i2c@3180000 {
		ds90ub947-q1@0c {
			compatible = "ti,ds90ub947-q1";
			reg = <0x0c>;

			/* Set OLDI_IN_MODE to single-pixel mode */
			/* Write 1 to bit 6 of register 0x47. Additional reg writes
			 * would simply be appended to this array */
			init-regs = <0x47 0x40 0x40>;
		};
	};
};
