Tegra maximum (junction) temperature reporting (virtual) sensor
---------------------------------------------------------------

This module reports the maximum SoC temperature (hottest point on the chip). It
polls on the temperatures from existing sensor devices (thermal zones), adds a
'hotspot offset' to the respective temperatures just polled, and, reports back
the maximum of all those values.

The participating zones and their respective hotspot offsets are configurable
via device tree.

This virtual sensor works completely on the polling mechanism supported by the
thermal core, and, doesn't have any interrupts support.

For more information on how to configure this driver, please look at
