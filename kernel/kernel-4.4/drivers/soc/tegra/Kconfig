config TEGRA_PROC_POWER_MODEL
	bool "Tegra process power model support"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	help
	  Used to create a simple processor power model (PPM) by
	  collating various chip specific data including voltage,
	  frequency, and number of cores. This driver is used by
	  various other drivers including EDP.

config TEGRA_CPU_EDP
	bool "Enforce electrical design limits on CPU rail (CPU EDP)"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	depends on CPU_FREQ && THERMAL
	default n
	select TEGRA_PROC_POWER_MODEL
	help
	  Enforce electrical design limits on CPU power rail. CPU
	  EDP prevents the CPU from drawing more current than its
	  voltage regulator can supply. Limit maximum CPU frequency
	  based on temperature and number of on-line CPUs to keep
	  CPU rail current within power supply capabilities.

config TEGRA_GPU_EDP
	bool "GPU EDP management"
	depends on THERMAL
	select TEGRA_PROC_POWER_MODEL
	default n
	help
	  Enforce electrical design limits on GPU power rail. GPU
	  EDP prevents the GPU from drawing more current than its
	  voltage regulator can supply. Limit maximum GPU frequency
	  based on temperature to keep GPU rail current within power
	  supply capabilities.

config TEGRA_DVFS
	bool
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	select PM_OPP
	help
	  This adds Tegra DVFS support. There could be several power
	  rails involved and there might be rails dependency based
	  on different SoCs, this config enable the generic DVFS
	  library needed by each SoCs DVFS files.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config TEGRA_210_DVFS
	bool "Tegra210 DVFS support"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC
	select TEGRA_DVFS
	help
	  This enable Tegra210 DVFS functionality, it implements SoC
	  specific initialization code to be invoked by probe function
	  defined in generic Tegra DVFS driver, so while enabled it
	  needs the config TEGRA_DVFS to be enabled as well.

config TEGRA_KFUSE
	bool "Tegra kfuse support"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	help
	  Enable Tegra kfuse support. The kfuse block stores downstream and
	  upstream HDCP keys for use by the HDMI module.
